# 2022-10 PKM System Development Update

##### Deprecated Philosophy from [[IDO-GeneSys]]
![[(DEPRECATED) Notemaking Philosophy & Workflow]]

Issue with the first version
- No dataview
- Defintions of note types are unclear and causes a lot of confusion and decision-paralysis in real usecases and disrupt fluid workflow
	- Accumulate unprocessed, dead ideas
	- No fun, linking-your-thinking-big-brain-people activity going on
- No automated changes in note status
- Useless status labels don't differentiate between types
- Inorgainic structure that doesn't make sense
- Rigid strucuture that allows no room for new structure to emerge
- Fancy names that I can't remember
- Arbitrary rules that serve no one

---

Fix
- Fluid with type and subtype
- useful tags
- independent system relevance tag
- dynamic dashboard notes with dataview
- automated archiving system and deprioritized folder
