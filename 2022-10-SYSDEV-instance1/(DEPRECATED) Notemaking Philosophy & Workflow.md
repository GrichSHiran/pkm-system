# (DEPRECATED) Notemaking Philosophy & Workflow

- A sown seed to propagated later, or note the small ideas around big topic without writing directly about a big topic that I don't have an idea about, yet.
- Never write directly on a definitive note—make atomic notes surrounding the subject which come together to inform a bigger picture.

## Note Logic and Hierarchy:
- Sources
- Directory (thoughtParliament)
- Temporary Holder (thoughtHurricane)
- Atomic Notes (generic)
- Established Conceptual Notes (definitive)
- Publish-ready Notes (publishable)

## Notemaking Workflow
1. First create a source note and write a brief summary of what the source is about;
2. Create a temporary holder with `compost` status:
	- this is where the study notes are poorly written in the spirit of trying to get yourself to understand the gist of it all as quickly as possible, and where ideas are shoved around on a canvas with the aim of discovering the best structure and *logical harmony*;
3. Create name-sake `definitive` notes of the important concepts;
4. Refactor self-contained ideas from the temporary holder into atomic notes with `sown` status;
5. Sequence ideas from atomic notes together to inform the `definitive` notes;
6. Change temporary holder status to `burried` once it has been completely refactored into individual, referenced atomic notes that are accordingly linked up together to inform bigger ideas.

## Architecture
### Six Status
- Sown
- Planted
- Rooted
- Skeletal
- Compost
- Buried

##### Seed Note Evolution

**Unsown (External Fleeting Notes):** A fleeting note from external sources—either from other note-taking apps or physical papers—that *has yet to be sown* onto the forrest floor of [[IDO-GeneSys]].

**Sown (Undeveloped Notes):** An orphan or loosely-connected note that has not been developed—a documented fleeting note. This is the first stage of any new idea that is *sown* onto the forrest floor of [[IDO-GeneSys]]

**Planted (Developing Notes):** A note in progress of being made into an evergreen note. This is the stage where an idea is *planted* but not yet rooted and weaved into the ecosystem of [[IDO-GeneSys]].

**Rooted (Permanent Notes):** An atomic note that has been connected to at least 10 other notes. This is the final stage of an idea where it is *rooted* into the ground as well as the ideological ecosystem of [[IDO-GeneSys]].

These notes are ready to grow into giant trees that will eventually intertwine with other ones to form arboreal canopies of ideas.

##### Other status

**Skeletal (Non-idea Notes):** A note whose purpose is not to contain ideas but rather to serve as a structure that facilitates propagation of ideas. It's something *dead and static* in the forest of [[IDO-GeneSys]] on which the shrubs and vines grow.

**Compost (Live-captured Notes):** A note whose purpose is get some shit—therefore *compost as in fertilized manure*—out of my head and onto the forrest floor of [[IDO-GeneSys]]. It may or may not birth new sprouts of evergreen notes, but at least it's there in the forrest, ready to fertilize and nourish new ideas. Once ideas has been extracted from them, their status moves on to buried.

**Buried (Keepsake Notes):** An archived note that doesn't directly contribute to the knowledge base. They are like detritus that simply gets *buried* into the ground of [[IDO-GeneSys]], not directly contributing to propagation of ideas but are providing subconscious inspiration and are ready to be dug up and rediscovered at any point in time.

### Note Types
- Skeletal by default:
	- system: Notes that informs the system of [[IDO-GeneSys]];
	- source: Notes that points to references, used for citation and bibliography;
	- person: A placeholder note of a person;
	- attachments: Other media which complement seed notes idea presentation;
	- thoughtParliament: A directory note of a particular interest;
- Seeds (Sown/Planted/Rooted):
	- generic: General ideas and observation;
	- definitive: An established subject, well-informed by multiple generic notes—a note is NOT truly definitive without the rooted status;
	- emergent: A native idea, bred internally within [[IDO-GeneSys]]—a note is not truly emergent without the rooted status;
	- publishable: A variant of seed notes that has the potential for publication;
- Detritus (buried when done):
	- thoughtHurricane: A note which captures the process of brainstorming or learning something new;
	- journal
	- dailyNote
	- actionable
